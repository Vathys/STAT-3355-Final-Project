1.) Did Texas become a more diverse state from 2000-2010?

Data needed:
	P3, P4, P5, P7, P8
	
2.) What is the distribution of race between urban and rural areas?

Data needed:
	H2, P2, PCT 11, PCT 23
	Same as above probably in the urban or rural regions (tracts?)
	
3.) Can we accurately predict the increase in population by the number of children?

Data needed:
	P1, P16

Try analysing the 2000 census to predict 2010 and use the same method for 2010 to predict 2020 pop

4.) Is there a correlation between multigenerational living and the number of children in a household?

Data needed:
	P16, 
	PCT 14, 
	Age by population? Go back to the first question about rising diversity and increasing.

5.) Which race is more likely to live in a multigenerational household?

Data needed:
	PCT 14
